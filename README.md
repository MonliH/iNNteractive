# nn_interactive
Interactive neural network with a GUI interface.

The neural network was implemented using Googleâ€™s Tensorflow API and the Keras API. The plotting was done through the Matplotlib module for Python. The builtin tkinter module was used to create the user interface. The Numpy module was used to generate the training data. The python file itself is about 400 lines long.
