# nn_interactive
Interactive neural network with a GUI interface.

The neural network was implemented using Googleâ€™s Tensorflow API and the Keras API. The plotting was done through the Matplotlib module for Python. The builtin tkinter module was used to create the user interface. The Numpy module was used to generate the training data. The python file itself is about 400 lines long.

This program will generate a neural netowrk to fit any function that you give it. Not tested on windows. Desgned for MacOS. Theoretically it should work on windows but im not sure.

* Training data generation
* Deep neural networks
* An interactive graph to visualize the training data and the neural network output
* Complete control over the structure of the neural network (amount of layers, number of neurons for each layer, etc)
* Different training methods
* Different cost functions
* A GUI interface
* Status bar for training
* Log files (loss, structure of neural network, time etc.)

I suggest you play around with the program as it is quite intivtive to use. The function syntax is the normal python syntax (e.g. power is `**` and there is `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`).

# Dependencies
* Python 3
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy

To install the python modules run:

```
> pip install matplotlib

> pip install tensorflow

> pip install keras

> pip install numpy
```
In your terminal if on windows, make sure you have Python 3 put in your path. If on any unix os, use `pip3` instead of `pip`
