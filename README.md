# nn_interactive
Interactive neural network with a GUI interface.

The neural network was implemented using Googleâ€™s Tensorflow API and the Keras API. The plotting was done through the Matplotlib module for Python. The builtin tkinter module was used to create the user interface. The Numpy module was used to generate the training data. The python file itself is about 400 lines long.

# Dependencies
* Python 3
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy

To install the python modules run:

```> pip install matplotlib

> pip install tensorflow

> pip install keras

> pip install numpy

```
In your terminal if on windows, make sure you have Python 3 put in your path. If on any unix os, use `pip3` instead of `pip`
